Ok wow I have not read this code in 3+ years and goddamn this is hot garbage.

I don't have a mac to test this on and I can't find my footage of what this looks like in action (buried somewhere on someone else's google drive) but uh it probably should work?

Only works on devices supporting Metal (macOS). Or I guess iOS/watchOS/tvOS if you're deranged enough to try to run this on those OSs.

To run the wave simulator, cd into wave-simulator and just `cargo run`.

Also I really don't know what was up with the names I chose...
